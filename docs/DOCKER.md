# Run with Docker

Self-hosting, with no Neon account and nothing to deploy. One container serves
the app, the API and the realtime websocket; a second runs Postgres.

Requires Docker with Compose v2 (`docker compose version`).

```bash
cp .env.docker.example .env
docker compose up
```

The first build compiles the frontend and takes a few minutes. When it is up,
the app is at:

```text
http://localhost:3142
```

Create an account on that page — the first sign-up is a normal one, there is no
seeded user. Use email and password. This creates a local account in the
deployment's Postgres database and does not require an account with Agensis,
Netlify, Google, or GitHub. Social sign-in is shown only when the site reports a
configured Netlify Identity provider, so those buttons are absent from the
self-hosted image. The database schema is applied on boot, so there is no
separate migration step.

Every value in `.env.docker.example` has a working default. Two are worth
reading before you expose this to anyone else: `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, and
`AGENSIS_AUTH_SECRET` (left empty, the server generates one on first boot and
keeps it in the database). `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` enables AI chat and can also be
set later in the running app under Settings → Secret keys.

To stop:

```bash
docker compose down
```

Uploads and the database survive that. To throw both away and start from an
empty database:

```bash
docker compose down -v
```

Everything below is reference. The section above is the whole of what a
first-time self-hoster needs.

## Environment

`.env.docker.example` is the full list. Nothing in it is required.

| Variable | Default | |
|---|---|---|
| `APP_PORT` | `3142` | Port the app is published on. |
| `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` | `agensis` | The bundled database. Port 5432 is deliberately not published, so it is reachable only on the compose network. `openssl rand -hex 16` if the host is shared. |
| `AGENSIS_AUTH_SECRET` | *(empty)* | Signs session tokens. Empty is correct for one instance — the server mints a secret on first boot and stores it in `app_settings`. Set it (`openssl rand -hex 32`) to run more than one app container against one database. Changing it signs everyone out. |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | *(empty)* | Enables AI chat. Also settable in-app. |
| `AGENSIS_APP_URL` | *(empty)* | Public origin for invite and join links. Defaults to the request's own host. |
| `AGENSIS_DISABLE_SIGNUP` | *(empty)* | Set to `1` to close public sign-up — see below. |
| `AGENSIS_SYSTEM_OWNER_EMAIL` | *(empty)* | The account that owns the Tenants admin surface. Also reserves that address at sign-up. |
| `VITE_BACKEND_BASE_URL` | *(empty)* | Only needed for HTTPS on a non-localhost hostname — see below. Baked into the bundle, so `docker compose build` after changing it. |

## Closing sign-up

Sign-up is **open by default**, and that is the right default for a first run —
the first thing you do is create your own account, and there is no seeded user
to do it for you. It is the wrong default the moment the deployment is reachable
from the internet: anyone who can load the page can create an account.

```bash
AGENSIS_DISABLE_SIGNUP=1
docker compose up -d
```

No rebuild — it is read by the server at request time, not baked into the
bundle. Every account-creation door refuses: password sign-up and, on the
Netlify lane, the social login that creates an account on first use.

This gates creation only. Sign-in still works and every existing account is
untouched, so switching it on cannot lock you out. To add somebody later,
comment it out, `docker compose up -d`, let them sign up, and put it back.

A stranger who signs up on an open deployment does not gain access to your
data — workspace membership is what grants that, and a new account has none.
What they gain is an account on your machine and whatever it can consume, which
is reason enough to close the door.

## Serving over HTTPS on your own hostname

Set `VITE_BACKEND_BASE_URL` to the same public origin you serve on:

```bash
VITE_BACKEND_BASE_URL=https://agensis.example.com
docker compose build && docker compose up -d
```

Without it the app loads and the API works, but realtime does not connect —
`realtimeDisabledOnThisHost()` in `src/lib/backendClient.ts` refuses to open a
websocket on an HTTPS non-loopback origin unless a backend URL was configured.
Localhost over HTTP is unaffected, which is why the default is empty.

## What happens on boot

`docker-entrypoint.sh` waits for Postgres, then applies the schema in a
specific order before starting the server:

1. **`database/neon-schema.sql`** via `psql` — the plain-Postgres bootstrap,
   what `npm run db:neon:push` applies. It is the only one of the three schema
   sources that creates the core tables (`app_users`, `workspaces`,
   `chat_sessions`, `messages`, `tasks`, …). Idempotent, so it runs every boot
   and a database left half-built by an interrupted first run repairs itself.
2. **`scripts/migrate.mjs`** — the incremental migrations. This has to come
   *second*: several files in `supabase/migrations/` are Supabase-flavoured
   (`auth.uid()`, RLS policies against `auth.users`) and would fail on stock
   Postgres. Run after step 1, the runner sees a complete core schema, backfills
   those files from its frozen baseline manifest without executing them, and
   applies only what is genuinely new.
3. **`ensureRuntimeSchema()`** in `server/index.cjs`, once the server starts. It
   only ever ADDs to an existing schema, so it cannot stand in for step 1.

Reversing 1 and 2 is the difference between a database that builds and one that
dies on the third migration. That ordering is the reason there is an entrypoint
script rather than a bare `CMD`.

On a genuinely fresh database the first boot logs one benign warning —
`startup agent-connection reconcile skipped: relation "agent_jobs" does not
exist` — because the startup reconcile does not wait for `ensureRuntimeSchema()`
to create that table. It is caught, it appears only once, and it predates the
container.

## How the frontend is served

The container adds a static-file route to the Node server; there is no nginx.

Production does **not** work this way: Netlify serves the built site and the Fly
backend serves only `/backend/*`, on a different origin. But the frontend is
already written for the single-origin case — `BACKEND_BASE` in
`src/lib/backendClient.ts` resolves to `''` on any host that is not `agensis.io`
or `*.netlify.app`, so `/backend/...` fetches are already same-origin-relative
and the websocket URL is already built from `window.location.host`. It needed
something to serve it, not a different client.

`server/static-site.cjs` is that route. It is mounted **last** in `createApp()`,
after every `/backend` route, so neither it nor its SPA fallback can shadow an
API route, and the fallback refuses `/backend` outright — a route that does not
exist returns the API's own 404, never `200` and an HTML page.

It is off unless `AGENSIS_STATIC_ROOT` is set. `fly.toml` does not set it, so
the Fly deployment is byte-for-byte unaffected. `Dockerfile.fly` is untouched
and still builds the backend-only production image.

An nginx service would have meant a second process and a second config to
achieve what one `express.static` call does, and it would have had to reproduce
the `/backend` and websocket routing rules rather than inherit them.

## The two images

| | `Dockerfile.fly` | `Dockerfile` |
|---|---|---|
| Used by | Fly production deploys | `docker compose`, self-hosting |
| Contains | backend only | backend + built frontend |
| Serves | `/backend/*` and the websocket | those, plus the app |

They are separate on purpose. Changing one does not change the other.

## Data

Two named volumes. `docker compose down` keeps both; `down -v` destroys both.

| Volume | Holds |
|---|---|
| `db-data` | Postgres |
| `uploads` | uploaded files, mounted at `/data` (`AGENSIS_UPLOAD_ROOT=/data/uploads`) |
