// The system-owner gate, and the read-only queries behind /backend/tenants.
//
// This module backs the ONE surface in the product that reads across tenant
// boundaries: a list of every registered account and, per account, the
// workspaces it owns and belongs to. Everything else in this codebase is scoped
// by workspace membership; this is not. That makes the gate below the whole
// feature, and the reason the queries live here rather than in either backend:
//
//   * ONE check. `assertSystemOwner` is the only thing that may authorize a
//     tenant route, and both backends call it. Two copies of an admin check
//     drift, and the copy that drifts is the one nobody is looking at.
//
//   * The caller's email is NEVER read from the request. It is resolved from
//     the authenticated `userId` against app_users. An email in a body, a query
//     string or a header is an attacker-supplied string, and comparing one of
//     those to the owner address would make the gate a formality.
//
//   * FAIL CLOSED. No configured owner, no such user, a DB error, a blank
//     address — every one of those is a refusal. `ensureSystemWorkspace` in
//     backend-core falls back to "the oldest account" when
//     AGENSIS_SYSTEM_OWNER_EMAIL is unset; that is a fine default for deciding
//     who owns an auto-created workspace and a catastrophic one for deciding
//     who may read every account on the deployment. There is deliberately no
//     fallback here.
//
//   * The projection is an allow-list, not a `select *`. app_users holds
//     `password_hash` and `token_version`; the column list comes from
//     backend-core's SELECTABLE_COLUMNS_BY_TABLE via `safeSelectColumns`, the
//     same allow-list the generic /backend/db/select route is held to, so a
//     sensitive column added to that table is excluded here by default rather
//     than by somebody remembering.
//
// Hiding the Tenants button from other users is cosmetic. This file is the
// control.

// What a tenant is USING: channels, DMs, threads, messages (split by who wrote
// them), huddles and the time spent in them, agents, live daemons, documents,
// members, and when anything last happened.
//
// COST, AND WHY IT IS SHAPED THIS WAY. The naive version of this feature is a
// handful of scalar sub-selects hanging off the account list — which is one
// query per account per statistic, i.e. N x 10 round trips for a list that is
// every account on the deployment. This is instead ONE query whose result is
// one row PER WORKSPACE, aggregated in Postgres and rolled up per account in
// JavaScript (`rollUpAccountStats`, pure and unit-tested).
//
// The cost is therefore fixed in ROUND TRIPS (one) and linear in ROWS SCANNED:
// each CTE is a single grouped pass over its table, and Postgres will hash-
// aggregate them. The expensive one is `msg` — a full scan of `messages` joined
// to `chat_sessions` — which is milliseconds on a deployment of this size and
// would want a materialized rollup somewhere north of a few million messages.
// Nothing here degrades with the number of ACCOUNTS, which is the axis that was
// going to hurt.
//
// Every CTE groups by workspace_id and is LEFT JOINed, so a workspace with no
// messages/huddles/agents produces a row of zeroes rather than vanishing.

// never selected here. This surface exists so a deployment owner can see the
// SHAPE of an account (what exists, how much, how recently touched) without it
// becoming a licence to read every customer's documents. Titles and names are
// the minimum that makes a list navigable; bodies are a different decision and
// should be taken deliberately, not inherited from an admin pane.
//
// Scoped to OWNED workspaces, matching the stats above: a shared workspace's
// contents belong to the account that owns it and would otherwise be counted
// against two people at once.
//
// Each returns { items, total } — `total` from a separate count so a capped
// list still tells the truth about how much is there.
